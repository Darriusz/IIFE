<h1>IIFE</h1>
<h2>Immediately Invoked Function Expression</h2>
<p>(function (){<br>
........;<br>
})();<br> the whole function in its own parentheses to keep it together and then (); to execute it</p>
<p>
When a later script invokes different functions in different script files but having variable of the same name, however we want the variables to be local to these individual functions.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The commented out functions dont't work properly when invoked from script3 as var name in gets the same value in both functions because it sits in the global scope (window)</li>
	<li>Solution: <b>fake namespaces.</b> In both functions we create a different object (in global scope) whose property is the name</li>


</ul>
